# LMTD Phase One - Final Project
Connecting the Dots

## About This Unit
The purpose of this unit is to give you the opportunity to showcase your knowledge of Linux, Python, and AWS with a final project that you will prepare to launch and present to the class.

## About The Project
With the knowledge that you have there are a number of different areas that you can focus with your new skills. Python is a great language to know not only for it's ability to handle Object-Oriented Programming, but also for it's ability to create and deploy serverside code. In this project, your group will be able to extend your knowledge of Python into the server-side space and add a front end client of your choosing for your users to interact with your program.

## Project Objective
Working with a group, your goal for this Lab is to use an Amazon EC2 server to host your python code that will allow you to interact with an API of your choosing and save data to the cloud.

Your program has a few requirements: 
1) Your program should use OOP python in some capacity 
2) Your program needs to be able to run on your team's AWS EC2 server 
3) Your program should use the `requests` module to interact with an API to bring in custom data 
4) Your program should write some custom data to a file that can be saved in `S3` 
5) Your team must use git to store your code commits on multiple branches.

You all can use any API you want to use but we will present some options that may spark some ideas. This Lab is an opportunity to build an application used for any real-world scenario of interest to your group. 

After you've finished with the required tasks your group should try extending your program to do more creative functionality.

## Collaborating as a Group

Your team is required to use Git and Github, and your final code should be able to be run from your EC2 server. In order to work on code on the AWS server you will need to properly set up your credentials so that you can SSH into your EC2.

## Presentation Requirements
### Project Name and Team
What is your project named? Who all is on your team? Everyone should give a brief introduction to themselves, (their name and role on the team) 

### Project Description
Give us a description of your project, what is it solving for or accomplishing? How did you come up with the idea? Put a list of the AWS services, Python modules, or external libraries you worked with on your slide so we can clearly see the tools and frameworks you used to get your project working.

### Project Demo
Give us a demo of your application and ensure that no parts of your demo crashes when you present.

### Code Review
Walk us through the code architecture, talk about some of the most important functions and files, and discuss your strategy for testing the code to ensure that it is working properly.

### Lessons Learned, Next Steps and Future Iterations
Discuss the way your team worked, and some of the challenges you had to overcome as a group. What did each of you learn after accomplishing this project? How did this project relate to the topics you learned in class about Linux, Git, Python, and AWS? If you could spend some more time on it or add additional features what would you say is next priority?

### Thank You! (Q&A)
Please include a Thank You slide with a link to your team's Github project and allow some time for a brief Q&A session.

## Submission
We will provide you a folder to submit your final presentation slides. Everyone is encouraged to take part in the presentations to some capacity but your PM is responsible for determining the best way to structure things on behalf of your group.
