# LMTD - Phase One
Intro to Cloud Technology & Foundational Cloud/DevOps Concepts
Linux, Python, and Cloud Computing with AWS

# Foundations of DevOps

**Instructors:** Cam Flowers and Shafan Sugarman

**Program Dates:** July 6th - August 29th

**Class Times:** TU, TH, FR 6:00-9:00 p.m. & SA 10 a.m.- 5:00 p.m.

**TA Office Hours:** Wednesdays 4:00-6:00 p.m.  

## Rationale

Some of the most exciting technological developments are occuring via cloud-based services deployed across the full tech stack. In this first phase of our program we will discuss the fundamentals of cloud-based programming using Linux, Python and deploy essential services utilizing AWS. 

## Course Aims and Outcomes 
### Aims
As a result of participating in this course, you will be able to explain the fundamental architecture of a cloud based tech stack, demonstrate proficiency in the fundamental scripting languages (BASH, Python), and create cloud based applications using modern frameworks in preparation for a healthy career in DevOps and related fields. 

### Specific Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be well-versed in the fundamentals of cloud-based programming in Python. You will be introduced to the Linux Operating System and learn to write scripts that communicate with the kernel. Building on this foundation, Python scripting frameworks are introduced; you will learn the concepts, syntax, and benefits of contemporary cloud computing (e.g. Virtualization, Cloud Storage, Cloud Monitoring). You will be able to develop interactive applications by the midterm of the course. The course will also introduce back-end web application concepts such as databases, application servers and cloud based hosting. By the completion of the course, you will be able to develop cloud managed applications and discuss the benefits of various architectures, design patterns, and elements of production-readyness. Specific concepts and technologies are highlighted in the course schedule below.

## Format and Procedures
This course meets three times a week and once on the weekend to facilitate both lecture and lab components of instruction. This course is intended to reflect industry norms as much as possible; to that end, project delivery and collaboration are emphasized over written homework or assessments. Sessions will not be recorded by default, though some materials may be pre-recorded to facilitate instruction. 

## Assumptions
This course has no prerequisite courses; however, you are expected to expediently learn new programming languages as they are introduced in this course. 

There is a guide of recommended precourse work available [here](./resources/precourse/README.md)


## Course Requirements
Tasks and assignments are intended to align with the learning outcomes specified above.

### Class attendance and participation policy

Attendance is a weighed component of this class, students are encouraged to attend all lectures to fully benefit from the delivered material and peer discussion. 

### Course readings

In adhering to "real-world" industry norms, this class does not have any required texts, as all course material can be obtained through various free online resources. However, various readings will be recommended during the course of this class and will likely be helpful to student learning.

## Academic Integrity

Each student in this course is expected to abide by a policy of Academic Integrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for  credit will be the student's own work. Collaboration is allowed where assignments are designated as group projects.

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy. 

## Reasonable Accommodations and Academic Adjustments

Our team is available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required for student with disabilities or reasonable accommodations.
